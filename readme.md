# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns placing X and O marks on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.

This project is a version of the game written using React.js. It is a single player game, with the player against the himself right now. The player will respond to each player's move and attempt to win the game.
